# 🌍 Amazighini
## 📌 Overview
Amazighini is a groundbreaking project developed during a 4-day hackathon organized by ThinkAI, supported by 1337 and Math&Maroc. The goal of this project is to bridge communication gaps by translating Tachelhit speech, a variant of the Tamazight language, into English text using generative AI technology.

## 🎯 Context
This project was crafted in a high-energy hackathon setting, aiming to create a practical AI tool that facilitates seamless communication between Tachelhit speakers and the English-speaking world.

## 🛠 Project Steps
### 1. Data Collection
#### 📂 Data Pipeline: Set up a robust system for data collection.0
#### 🎙️ Audio Collection: Gathered .wav files with spoken Tachelhit.
#### 📝 Transcription: Created CSV files with English translations for the audio files.
### 2. Model Fine-Tuning
##### 🤖 AI Tuning: Selected the Seamless text-to-speech model for enhancement with our curated dataset.
### 3. Model Testing
##### ✔️ Testing: Conducted extensive testing to ensure translation accuracy and contextual relevance.
#### 💡 Challenges and Achievements
#### Data Scarcity: Faced the challenge of limited Tachelhit data.
#### Technological Integration: Worked on integrating advanced AI with a less commonly digitized language.
#### Rapid Development: Developed a functioning prototype within the limited timeframe of the hackathon.
## 🚀 Future Work
### 📊 Data Expansion: Plan to enrich the dataset for better model performance.
### ⚙️ Continuous Improvement: Aim to enhance accuracy and usability.
### 📱 Application Development: Looking to create an accessible application for wider use.
