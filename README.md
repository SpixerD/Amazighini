# Amazighini

Overview
Amazighini is a groundbreaking project developed during a 4-day hackathon organized by ThinkAI, with the collaborative support of 1337 and Math&Maroc. The goal of Amazighini is to facilitate communication between speakers of Tachelhit (a variant of the Tamazight language) and English by translating Tachelhit speech into English text. This project utilizes generative AI to bridge language barriers and foster better understanding and integration.

Context
This project was conceived and executed within the confines of a competitive and intensive hackathon environment. Our team focused on addressing the communication challenges faced by Tachelhit speakers by creating an AI model capable of understanding and translating spoken Tachelhit into English. This technology aims to provide a practical tool for both everyday and professional communication.

Project Steps
1. Data Collection
Our initial phase focused on establishing a comprehensive data acquisition pipeline. We collected numerous .wav files containing spoken Tachelhit phrases and produced corresponding CSV files that include translated English transcripts. This dataset forms the backbone of our training process, ensuring the model can accurately grasp the nuances of Tachelhit speech.

2. Model Fine-Tuning
We chose the Seamless text-to-speech model for fine-tuning, leveraging our uniquely gathered dataset. This phase was critical in adapting the pre-existing model to understand and process Tachelhit accurately, a language with considerably different phonetics and syntax compared to English.

3. Model Testing
The final step involved rigorous testing to evaluate the model’s performance in real-world scenarios. We conducted multiple tests to ensure the translations were not only accurate but also contextually relevant, making adjustments as needed to refine the model's output.

Challenges and Achievements
Data Scarcity: One of the significant challenges was the limited availability of structured Tachelhit language data suitable for AI training.
Technological Integration: Adapting advanced AI models to a less commonly digitized language presented unique technical hurdles.
Rapid Development: Developing a fully functional prototype within a four-day hackathon required intense focus, quick decision-making, and efficient teamwork.
Future Work
Looking ahead, we aim to expand the dataset, enhance the model’s accuracy with continuous training, and increase its applicability in various professional fields such as education, healthcare, and tourism. Furthermore, we plan to develop a user-friendly application to make our technology accessible to a broader audience.
